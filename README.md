    <i>Verifiable vector similarity queries over a committed vector database.</i>
  </p>
</p>

This projects aims to obtain a proof-of-concept for a verifiable vector database using zero-knowledge proofs. We make heavy use of the awesome [ZKFixedPointChip](https://github.com/DCMMC/ZKFixedPointChip) which enables fixed-point arithmetic with [halo2-lib](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib).

## Installation

You need Rust installed:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, you can clone this repository and use the chips inside it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/erhant/halo2-vectordb.git
cd halo2-vectordb
```

## Usage

We implement two chips, one for distance metrics in halo2, and the other for basic vector database operations.

### [`DistanceChip`](./src/gadget/distance.rs)

`DistanceChip` provides distance metrics that operate on two vectors of equal length. The vector elements are expected to be quantized with the `FixedPointChip`. The following distance metrics are implemented:

- `euclidean_distance` computes the Euclidean distance between two vectors.
- `manhattan_distance` computes the Manhattan distance between two vectors.
- `hamming_distance` computes one minus Hamming similarity between two vectors.
- `cosine_distance` computes one minus Cosine similarity between two vectors.

### [`VectorDBChip`](./src/gadget/vectordb.rs)

`VectorDBChip` implements basic vector database functionality over a set of vectors. Similar to `DistanceChip`, it requires a `FixedPointChip` to operate over quantized values. It exposes the following functions:

- `nearest_vector` is given a set of vectors and a query vector, and finds the vector that is most similar to the query w.r.t. a given distance function. It also returns an indicator (i.e. one-hot encoded vector that indicates the index of the result vector) which may be used at later steps.
- `merkle_commitment` commits to a set of vectors using a Merkle tree with Poseidon hashes. If the given set does not include power-of-two many elements, it will pad zeros to the remaining leaves.
- `kmeans` is given a set of vectors, a `K` parameter to determine the number of centroids and an `I` parameter to determine the number of iterations. K-means usually is an iterative algorithm that terminates when the centroids are no more updated; however, such a control-flow is not possible in a zk-circuit. Therefore, the `I` parameter determines a fixed number of iterations.

<!-- ## Demonstration

A demonstrative test suite can be found at [`demo_test`](./tests/demo_test.rs). It does the following:

## Examples

Run the examples via one of the following:

```sh
# demonstrate distance computations
LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example distances -- \
  --name distances -k 13 mock

# example merkle commitment to vectors
LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example merkle -- \
  --name merkle -k 13 mock

# exhaustively find the similar vector & commit to the database
LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example exhaustive -- \
  --name exhaustive -k 13 mock

# compute centroids
LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example kmeans -- \
  --name kmeans -k 13 mock
```

<!-- LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example euclid -- --name euclid -k 13 mock -->

You can provide a specific input via the `--input <input-name>` option.

## Testing

We plan on testing our implementations over vectors from `ANN_SIFT_10K` by [JÃ©gou et al.](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00514462/en) from [Corpus-Texmex](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), which is composed of 10K 128-dimensional vectors. We have downloaded the dataset and store it under `res` folder.

To run tests:

```sh
cargo test
```
