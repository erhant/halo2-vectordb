    <i>Verifiable vector similarity queries over a committed vector database.</i>
  </p>
</p>

We are given a set of embedding vectors. These vectors are typically composed of floating point values, which is an issue for our arithmetic circuits that operate over integers modulo some large prime. Thankfully, an awesome work by Wentao Xiao enables fixed-point arithmetic in Halo2: [ZKFixedPointChip](https://github.com/DCMMC/ZKFixedPointChip). We will make heavy use of this chip.

After this, we have several vectors in the database along with a query vector. We would like the circuit to find a vector in the database that is similar to our query vector. This task has two aspects:

-   The vector similarity algorithms should be verifiable, i.e. we need to implement chips for them.
-   The database should be committed to, ensuring that the verifiable similarity algorithm has been used on all vectors.

### Distance Metrics

We provide a `SimilarityChip` that operate on two vectors $a, b$ of length $n$, and exposes the following metrics:

-   **Cosine Similarity**
-   **Hamming Similarity**
-   **Manhattan Distance**
-   **Euclidean Distance**

### Committing to a Database

For each computation, the prover commits to the vectors used in the process. For example, an exhaustive search over the entire database results in a vector that is most similar to the query, along with a Merkle root over the entire database, where the leave nodes are Poseidon hashes of the quantized vectors.

## Usage

Run the examples via one of the following:

```sh
LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example similarities -- --name similarities --input vec4.in -k 13 mock

LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example exhaustive -- --name exhaustive -k 13 mock

LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example merkle_poseidon -- --name merkle_poseidon -k 13 mock

LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example exhaustive_merkle -- --name exhaustive_merkle --input query1.in -k 13 mock
```

You can provide a specific input via the `--input <input-name>` option.

## Testing

We plan on testing our implementations over vectors from `ANN_SIFT_10K` by [JÃ©gou et al.](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00514462/en) from [Corpus-Texmex](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), which is composed of 10K 128-dimensional vectors. We have downloaded the dataset and store it under `res` folder.
