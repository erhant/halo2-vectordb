    <i>Verifiable vector similarity queries over a committed vector database.</i>
  </p>
</p>

We are given a set of embedding vectors. These vectors are typically composed of floating point values, which is an issue for our arithmetic circuits that operate over integers modulo some large prime. Thankfully, an awesome work by Wentao Xiao enables fixed-point arithmetic in Halo2: [ZKFixedPointChip](https://github.com/DCMMC/ZKFixedPointChip). We will make heavy use of this chip.

After this, we have several vectors in the database along with a query vector. We would like the circuit to find a vector in the database that is similar to our query vector. This task has two aspects:

-   The vector similarity algorithms should be verifiable, i.e. we need to implement chips for them.
-   The database should be committed to, ensuring that the verifiable similarity algorithm has been used on all vectors.

### Similarity Algorithms

We provide a `SimilarityChip` that operate on two vectors $a, b$ of length $n$, and exposes the following functions:

-   `cosine_similarity`

$$
\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i \cdot b_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} b_i^2}}
$$

-   `euclidean_similarity`

$$
\sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (a_i - b_i)^2}
$$

-   `dot_product_similarity`

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i\cdot b_i
$$

-   `hamming_similarity`

$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} [a_i = b_i]
$$

TODO: if time permits, more advanced algorithms?

### Committing to a Database

TODO: merkle the entire thing? treat vectors as polys and commit to them (e.g. KZG?)

## Usage

Some usage scripts (will be updated as time goes on):

```sh
# integer dot product example
cargo run --example int_dot_product -- --name int_dot_product -k 8 mock

# fixed point example
LOOKUP_BITS=12 cargo run --example euclidean -- --name euclidean -k 13 mock
```

## Testing

We plan on testing our implementations over vectors from `ANN_SIFT_10K` by [JÃ©gou et al.](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00514462/en) from [Corpus-Texmex](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), which is composed of 10K 128-dimensional vectors.
