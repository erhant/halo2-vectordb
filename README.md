# Halo2 VectorDB

Verifiable vector similarity queries over a committed vector database.

## Methodology

We are given a set of embedding vectors. These vectors are typically composed of floating point values, which is an issue for our arithmetic circuits that operate over integers modulo some large prime. To combat this problem, we will use [Scalar Quantizaiton](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/), a process that converts floating-point values to integers (e.g. 32-bit floating-point values are reduced to 8-bit integers), and our circuits will operate over these integer valued vectors.

After this, we have several vectors in the database along with a query vector. We would like the circuit to find a vector in the database that is similar to our query vector. This task has two aspects:

-   The vector similarity algorithms should be verifiable, i.e. we need to implement chips for them.
-   The database should be committed to, ensuring that the verifiable similarity algorithm has been used on all vectors.

### Scalar Quantization

TODO: can we do this verifiably?

### Similarity Algorithms

We provide a `SimilarityChip` that operate on two vectors $a, b$ of length $n$, and exposes the following functions:

-   `cosine_similarity`

$$
\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i \cdot b_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n b_i^2}}
$$

-   `euclidean_similarity`

$$
\sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n (a_i - b_i)^2}
$$

-   `dot_product_similarity`

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i\cdot b_i
$$

-   `hamming_similarity`

$$
\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n[a_i = b_i]}{n}
$$

TODO: if time permits, more advanced algorithms?

### Committing to a Database

TODO: merkle the entire thing? treat vectors as polys and commit to them (e.g. KZG?)

## Testing

We plan on testing our implementations over vectors from `ANN_SIFT_10K` by [JÃ©gou et al.](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00514462/en) from [Corpus-Texmex](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), which is composed of 10K 128-dimensional vectors.
